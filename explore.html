                    <h3>Pomodoro Timer</h3>
                    <p>The Podomoro study technique is a popular way of managing time when studying. It works very well with people who struggle with staying focused throughout the day and get distracted easily. This also works very well with people who like to gamify their goal-settings. The Podomoro technique is a method in which an individual sets themselves a task goal (study biology) and they try to complete it during 3-5 25 minute focus time intervals. In between the intervals there is a 5 minute break but after completing 4 intervals the break is 20 minutes. This helps keep the mind fresh while studying for long periods of time.

                    <h3>Feynman's Technique</h3>
                    <p>The feynman technique is a study method that focuses on the understanding of a topic. The key idea is to learn through the act of teaching. The goal of this method is to improve your explanation skills by picking the topic you're studying then trying to teach it to a 6th grader which is surprisingly challenging since the average 6th grade student doesn't understand hard terminology meaning that the person needs to simplify the topic and this is only possible if you truly understand the topic. So to implement this method all you need to do is to pick the topic that you are studying, place all books and other materials away and write on a paper an explanation that could be given to a 6th grader. Although this method is simple it requires a lot of time, it is very effective since it requires a lot of mental energy.

                    <h3>Spaced Repetition</h3>
                    <p>Spaced repetition is a study technique that helps you memorise things long term through revision and recall of information over spaced study sessions until the information is learned. This method is important when it comes to improving long-term memory and allows people to break down long hours of studying into smaller smaller study sessions. Spaced repetition is a method in which study sessions for a particular exam are spread out between the time you start studying and the exam date. For example if the exam is in 3 weeks the study sessions should be every 3-4 days while if it is in 1 week the study sessions should be either everyday or every other day depending on how large and difficult the topic is. This way it's easier and less tiring to study for exams and helps avoid last minute studying.

                    <h3>Leitner System</h3>
                    <p>Leitner method is a study method that uses flashcards, spaced repetition and cardboard boxes to help people memorise and learn a topic. In this method 3 cardboard boxes are used to organise an individual's study flashcards. After reviewing the cards all the ones that you got correct go into box 2 and are reviewed every other day, while the cards that were incorrect are placed in box 1 and are reviewed daily. If there are any cards in box 2 once they are reviewed the ones that were correct go to box 3 which are reviewed once a week while the ones that were in correct go back to box 1. This method is really effective and takes advantage of spaced repetition and active recall.
