                    <h3>Pomodoro Timer</h3>
                    <p>The Podomoro study technique is a popular way of managing time when studying. It works very well with people who struggle with staying focused throughout the day and get distracted easily. This also works very well with people who like to gamify their goal settings. The Podomoro technique was invented in the late 1980s by university student Francesco Cillio. He had been struggling to concentrate so he took a tomato-shaped kitchen timer and told himself to commit 10 minutes of focused study time. He then went on to write a book about this method. 

                        The Podomoro study technique is a popular way of managing time when studying. It works very well with people who struggle with staying focused throughout the day and get distracted easily. This also works very well with people who like to gamify their goal settings. The Podomoro technique is a method in which an individual sets themselves a task goal (study biology) and tries to complete it during 3-5 25-minute focus time intervals. In between the intervals, there is a 5-minute break but after completing 4 intervals the break is 20 minutes. This helps keep the mind fresh while studying for long periods of time
                        
                        When using this method there are 5 simple steps. Start by creating a to-do list and then get a timer and set it to 25 minutes, and focus on one of your tasks for the next  25 minutes. After the timer, rings check what you completed and take a 5-minute break. Once the break set the timer again to 25 minutes and repeat this process 3 more times each with a 5-minute break in between. After completing 4 of these 25-minute sessions take a long 15-30 minute break. To get the most out of these intervals tasks and projects should be broken down, and phones should also be put on silent and put away. 
                        
                        The Pomodoro technique is an effective study method because it is easy to start, helps fight back procrastination, helps us be more productive with our time since we have a plan on how to use it, gamifies your productivity making it more fun, and it helps fight distractions since studies show that most distractions that we get are actually caused by the person themselves.

                    <h3>Feynman's Technique</h3>
                    <p>The Feynman technique is a study method that is very simple but is often hard to successfully implement in people's study sessions since it requires a lot of time. The Feynman technique was developed by Nobel prize-winning physicist Richard P.Feynman.The key idea of the Feynman technique is learning through the act of teaching. The goal of this method is to improve your explanation skills by picking the topic you're studying and then trying to teach it to a 6th grader since the average 6th-grade student doesn’t understand hard terminology meaning that the person needs to simplify the topic and this is only possible if you truly understand the topic. This method is used to memorise and understand a difficult subject, which requires more mental energy than other study methods which makes it more effective. 

                        The Feynman technique is a study method that focuses on understanding of a topic. The key idea is to learn through the act of teaching. The goal of this method is to improve your explanation skills by picking the topic you're studying and then trying to teach it to a 6th grader which is surprisingly challenging since the average 6th-grade student doesn’t understand hard terminology meaning that the person needs to simplify the topic and this is only possible if you truly understand the topic. So to implement this method all you need to do is to pick the topic that you are studying, place all books and other materials away and write on a paper an explanation that could be given to a 6th grader. Although this method is simple it requires a lot of time, but it is very effective since it requires a lot of mental energy.
                        
                        When using this method follow these 5 steps. First, identify the topic you want to learn. Then try to explain the topic as if you're teaching a 6th grader. Once you are done identify areas of improvement for your explanation by asking someone else to read it and rewrite the explanation. Repeat step 3 until you achieve the perfect explanation
                        
                        The Feynman technique is an effective study method because it allows you to improve your explanation skills, review skills and analysis skills, which helps you understand the topic better. This study method is also good because it uses active engagement unlike re-reading the subject textbook or notes. It as well allows students to apply what they learnt in a meaningful way.

                    <h3>Spaced Repetition</h3>
                    <p>Spaced repetition is a study technique that helps you memorise things long-term through revision and recall of information over spaced study sessions until the information is learned. This method is important when it comes to improving long-term memory and allows people to break down long hours of studying into smaller study sessions. This means that studying can become more fun and moving deeper into topics during the following years will be easier. This method is easy to implement but often is hard to stick to since people often are impatient to learn something new. 

                        Spaced repetition is a study technique that helps you memorise things long-term through revision and recall of information over spaced study sessions until the information is learned. This method is important when it comes to improving long-term memory and allows people to break down long hours of studying into smaller study sessions. Spaced repetition is a method in which study sessions for a particular exam are spread out between the time you start studying and the exam date. For example, if the exam is in 3 weeks the study sessions should be every 3-4 days while if it is in 1 week the study sessions should be either every day or every other day depending on how large and difficult the topic is. This way it's easier and less tiring to study for exams and helps avoid last-minute studying. 
                        
                        There are multiple benefits and applications for this specific study method. The biggest benefit of this method is that it helps people memorise things better. Another benefit of this technique is that it allows people to break down long hours of studying into smaller study sessions. It also allows the new information learnt to be processed and settled in with the old. Another good reason to use spaced repetition is that even after the test has passed you are more likely to have some memory of what you learned than when using other study methods.
                        
                        When using this method there are 4 simple steps to follow. Make a plan with all your spaced-out study sessions. The length of these sessions depends on the subject you are studying but on average take 2 hours to study. ( day 1, day 7, day 16, day 35 then test.) Then study and review the study material for the first time. This includes going through your highlights, questions,  reading material suggested by the subject teacher, and looking more at areas that need more attention. Next you have the second session in which you should follow the same steps as in the first session to strengthen your memory. The last step is to just review what you have learned over the last 2 sessions in the next few intervals until the test date.

                    <h3>Leitner System</h3>
                    <p>The Leitner method is a study method that uses flashcards, spaced repetition and cardboard boxes to help people memorise and learn a topic. This study method was created by a german journalist named Sebastian Leitner. He came up with this method while writing his book “ how to learn to learn” which was published in 1972. This system is mainly built to help people prioritise topics that need more attention. This method also takes advantage of spaced repetition.

                        The Leitner method is a study method that uses flashcards, spaced repetition and cardboard boxes to help people memorise and learn a topic. In this method, 3 cardboard boxes are used to organise an individual's study flashcards. After reviewing the cards all the ones that you got correct to go into box 2 and are reviewed every other day, while the cards that were incorrect are placed in box 1 and are reviewed daily. If there are any cards in box 2 once they are reviewed the ones that were correct go to box 3 which are reviewed once a week while the ones that were incorrect go back to box 1. This method is really effective and takes advantage of spaced repetition and active recall.
                        
                        When using this method there are 4 simple steps. Start by taking a piece of paper and making flashcards based on what you are trying to learn. When the cards are done take 3 boxes and name them box 1, box 2, and box 3. Then start by placing all the cards in box 1 and start reviewing them by trying to answer the questions. Once you have finished reviewing the cards place all the cards that you got correct into box 2 and keep the cards that you got incorrect in box 1. Now all the cards that are in box 1 should be reviewed every day while the cards in box 2 should be reviewed every other day and the cards in box 3 should be reviewed once per week. When reviewing cards in the box place all the cards that you got incorrect in box 1 and all the cards that you got correct in box 3. When reviewing cards in box 3 place the cards that you got incorrect in box 2 and keep the cards that you got correct in box 3
                        
                        This method is very effective especially since it uses both spaced repetition and active recall. Spaced repetition is used in this method through systematic intervals between the time that you study the flashcards. Active recall is used through self-testing with flashcards, which is a common method of active recall.
