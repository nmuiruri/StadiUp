        <h1>Pomodoro timer</h1>
        <div class="flex_list">
          <p>The Podomoro study technique is a popular way of managing time when studying. It works very well with people who struggle with staying focused throughout the day and get distracted easily. This also works very well with people who like to gamify their goal-settings. The Podomoro technique was invented in the late 1980s by university student Fracesco Cillio. He had been struggling to concentrate so he took a tomato shaped kitchen timer and told himself to commit 10 minutes of focused study time. He then went on to write a book about this method.</p>

        <h1>Spaced repetition</h1>
        <div class="flex_list">
        <p>Spaced repetition is a study technique that helps you memorise things long term through revision and recall of information over spaced study sessions until the information is learned. This method is important when it comes to improving long-term memory. This means that the information learned is now easier to be transferred into other contexts. This method also allows people to spend less time studying and gives them more time to do other activities or study of other subjects. This method is easy to implement but often is hard to stick to since people often are impatient to learn something new.

          There are multiple benefits and applications for this specific study method. The biggest benefit of this method is that it helps people memorise things better. Another benefit of this technique is that it allows people to break down long hours of studying into smaller smaller study sessions. It also allows the new information learnt to be processed and settled in with the old. Another good reason to use spaced repetition is because even after the test has past you are more likely to have some memory of what you learned than when using other study methods.

        <h1>Leitner method</h1>
        <div class="flex_list">
        <p>The Leitner method is a study method that uses flashcards, spaced repetition and cardboard boxes to help people memorise and learn a topic. This study method was created by a german journalist named sebastian Leitner. He came up with this method while writing his book “ how to learn to learn” which was published in 1972. This system is mainly built to help people prioritise topics that need more attention. This method also takes advantage of spaced repetition.

          When using this method there are 4 simple steps:
          </p>
          <ol class="Leirner_method_steps">
            <li>Take a piece of paper and make flashcards based on what you are trying to learn.</li>
            <li>When the cards are done take 3 boxes and name them box 1, box 2, and box 3.
            </li>
            <li>Now start by placing all the cards in box 1 and start reviewing them by trying to answer the questions.</li>
            <li>Once you have finished reviewing the cards place all the cards that you got correct into box 2 and keep the cards that you got incorrect in box 1 </li>
            <li>Now all the cards that are in box 1 should be reviewed everyday while the cards in box 2 should be reviewed every other day and the cards in box 3 should be reviewed once per week</li>
            <li>When reviewing cards in box to place all the cards that  you got incorrect in box 1 and all the cards that you got correct in box 3.</li>
            <li>When reviewing cards in box 3 place the cards that you got incorrect in box 2 and keep the cards that you got correct in box 3</li>

        <h1>Feynman's technique</h1>
        <div class="flex_list">
        <p>The feynman technique is a study method that is very simple but is often hard to successfully implement in peoples study sessions, since it requires a lot of time. The feynman technique was developed by a nobel prize winning physicist Richard P.Feynman. The key idea of the Feynman technique is learning through the act of teaching. The goal of this method is to improve your explanation skills by picking the topic you're studying then trying to teach it to a 6th grader since the average 6th grade student doesn’t understand hard terminology meaning that the person needs to simplify the topic and this is only possible if you truly understand the topic. This method is used to memorise and to understand a difficult subject, which requires more mental energy than other study methods which makes it more effective. 
        </p>
        <ol class="feynman steps">
          <li>identify the topic you want to learn and explain</li>
          <li>Explain the topic as if your teaching a 6th grader</li>
          <li>Once you are done identify areas of improvement for your explanation by asking someone else to read it and rewrite the explanation.
          </li>
          <li>Repeat step 3 until you achieve the perfect explanation</li>
        </ol>
